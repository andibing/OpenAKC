_Server Installation_

If installing from packages's rather than a repo, you may first need to ensure
that some dependencies are installed.  At the time of writing, a standard
minimal "CentOS container" requires the following packages to be installed
in advance:-

Eg.
yum install openssh-clients openssl xinetd openssl sudo which

For a minimal Ubuntu, installing the extra depenencies is also required
if not using a repo.

Eg.
apt isntall xinetd

Then, simply install packages "openakc-server" & "openakc-tools"







_Client Installation_

If installing from packages's rather than a repo, you may first need to ensur
that some dependencies are installed.  At the time of writing, a standard
minimal "CentOS container" requires the following packages to be installed
in advance:-

Eg.
yum install e2fsprogs openssh-clients openssh-server openssl which

For a minimal Ubuntu, installing extra dependencies is currently not
required on the client host.

Then simply install package "openakc"







_System Setup_

In a minimal installation, the only configuration required is to ensure that
the hosts listed in the client config (/etc/openakc/openakc.conf) (which can
be either name or IP) are configured to refer to the appropriate server. 
These values are pre-populated with "openakc01 & openakc02", so you could
simply ensure that these values are configured in DNS, or in the /etc/hosts
on the client file for testing, or alter them as you prefer.

Verify Server

To verify the correct operation of the server, simply have a non-root user
create an ssh key pair (with pass phrase), and attempt to register that key.

#openakc register

Now attempt to connect to your a client machine, this will demonstrate that
you cannot connect, and also allow the server to learn about the client
which will help later on (you will not be permitted to log in).

Designating one or more security administrators.

For a (registered) user who you wish to make a "security administrator",
take the file from the users home folder:-

~[user]/.openakc/openakc-user-client-[user]-pubkey.pem and place this in the
root owned folder /var/lib/openakc/keys

This user will now be able to run call the role management functions in the
api tool,

Eg.
openakc editrole root@test-client

Examine the comments, and example role "block" shown, and create one
defining access for a user or group, and then test.

Now examine the logs on each host to see what was logged, as well as check
the keystroke log written to /var/lib/openakc/keylogs on the server.
