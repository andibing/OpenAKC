# OpenAKC
Dynamic SSH key manager / privilaged access management tool for Linux (and possibly other unix like platforms).

WARNING: This is pre-release software and although it is functional, plenty of work remains to ensure it is robust and secure.

There is precious little documentation as yet, but please find a demo [here].  Any contributions of in regard to documentation (or anything else) would be greatly appreciated.

Please note that most of this tool is created using shell code, I hope this makes it approachable for sysadmins (as the likely users), to contribute.
