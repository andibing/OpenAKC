This script sets up unprivilaged lxc for the current user, builds 2
containers, and uses them to build the debian packages, and install a
test/demo environment for the user to experiment with.... setting up ssh
keys, registering them, and setting a basic role configuration to allow a
test user to gain access to an account.

--yes - Don't ask questions and proceed
(will still stop if root password is needed)

--norebuild - Don't rebuild containers.

--nocompile - Dont compile packages (only useful for debugging etc.)

--noinstall - Don't install packages (only useful for debugging etc.)


Enjoy.

J. Lewis.
