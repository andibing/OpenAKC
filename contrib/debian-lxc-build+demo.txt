This script sets up unprivilaged lxc for the current user, builds 2
containers, and uses them to build the debian packages, and install a
test/demo environment for the user to experiment with.... setting up ssh
keys, registering them, and setting a basic role configuration to allow a
test user to gain access to an account.

WARNING!!! - Ultimately this script has turned out to be mostly about making
sure Unprivilaged LXC containers work on your system. It turns out that this
is a much harder task than installing OpenAKC.  We do our best to configure
everything for you, however if it's already configuredm simply assume it works
rather than change existing config.  Please keep this in mind as you
proceed.  If you are unsure, please consider following the "quickstart"
guide instead.

This has been tested on vanilla installs of Debian 10 (Buster), Ubuntu 18.04
(Bionic), Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) - including PopOS.


--yes - Don't ask questions and proceed
(will still stop if root password is needed)

--dnsfix - will override container dns config with google DNS servers.

--norebuild - Don't rebuild containers.

--nocompile - Dont compile packages (only useful for debugging etc.)

--noinstall - Don't install packages (only useful for debugging etc.)



Enjoy.

J. Lewis.
