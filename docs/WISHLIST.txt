*Blocking For 1.0 Release*

* Code review, fix up input validation.

* Default role file assigned to a host when first discovered.

* Review "key" type, can we refer to a key by some "tag" other than
  fingerprint.

*Possible Future Enhancements*

* Offer some method to push values into users shell profile, like aliases,
  default, or even read only environment variables.

* Allow roles to be associated with a user or hostname including wildcards.

* Tool to allow users to query what is required for access to a given host,
  and/or to determine why they were not permitted access,
  (require SYSTEM rights so it's not publically available).
